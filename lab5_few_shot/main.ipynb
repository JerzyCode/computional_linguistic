      "\n",
      "To ensure that the formalization process maintains the original intent and tone of the informal sentences while adhering to formal language standards, one must understand the nuances of both informal and formal communication. Here are some strategies to achieve this balance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understand the Context**: Before formalizing, it's crucial to understand the context in which the informal sentence was used. This includes the relationship between the speaker and the listener, the setting, and the purpose of the communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preserve the Subject Matter**: The subject matter of the original sentence should remain unchanged. The formal version should convey the same information or request as the informal one.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Maintain Politeness and Respect**: Formal language often employs a higher level of politeness and respect. This can be achieved by using courteous phrases, avoiding slang, and choosing words that are universally accepted as respectful.\n",
      "\n",

      "Starting with the first one: \"Hey, can you send me that file?\" becomes \"Please send me that file.\" That makes sense because \"Hey\" is informal, and \"Please\" is more formal. \"Can you send\" is direct, so changing it to a polite request makes it formal.\n",

      "Now, the fourth sentence is \"Could you like, maybe check this for mistakes?\" The user left the \"after\" field empty. Hmm, I need to make this formal.
